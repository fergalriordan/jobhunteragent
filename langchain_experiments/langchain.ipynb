      "Here's my feedback on your CV:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Contact Information:** Keep it simple. Try to use a more professional email address. You don't need to include your nationality or mention \"Willing to relocate\". These matters can be discussed in an interview.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Profile:** Your profile or summary is a great way to introduce yourself. However try to make it more compelling, with strong verbs and specific examples of what you have accomplished in the context of \"building responsible, human-centred AI solutions\".\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Technical Skills:** You might want to reformat this section to focus on the skills that are most relevant to the job you are applying for. Absolutely keep Python, PyTorch, Azure, Docker, and Git, but you might also want to drill down on specific AI and Machine Learning skills. \n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Professional Experience:** This section is well laid out and detailed, but make sure your accomplishments are quantifiable where possible. For example, if you helped increase efficiency or revenue, mention how much.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Relevant Projects:** Your Master's thesis sounds very interesting, especially the improvements you achieved in GAN performance. Feel free to mention any recognition you received or any interesting outcomes. For the personal project, consider talking about if you are planning to deploy it or if it’s available for the public to use.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Education:** This section is fine, but consider including a brief description of your key takeaways or accomplishments from your Master’s degree. \n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Languages:** Excellent to see you're multilingual. This is often a valuable asset in diverse, multinational tech teams.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Soft Skills:** Try to provide a few real-world examples of you demonstrating these skills. For example, how did your strong work ethic enable you to manage a complex project? How did your communication skills support your team during stressful times?\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **Hobbies:** Unique hobbies like scuba diving or guitar make you memorable. Where relevant, tie these to transferable skills or company values. \n",
      "\n",
      "10. **Formatting:** There are a few characters being misread, like â€. Edit and proofread your CV to ensure it's clean and professional. Don't exceed two pages if you can.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, consider tailoring your CV to each job posting. Highlight the most relevant skills and experiences on your CV depending on the role you're applying for. Good luck!\n"
