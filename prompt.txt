About the job
We are a high-growth Series-B InsurTech start-up using data and machine learning to revolutionize the insurance industry. You will be joining a strong and mission driven team, working to build a customer facing product that fundamentally changes the way insurers evaluate risk, enabling them to move from highly manual workflows to digital risk flows.
Cytora’s Risk Stream is a serverless and cloud native SaaS platform that automates the digitisation, evaluation and decisioning of risks for commercial insurers. Our product drastically improves the working lives of our users, enables our customers to cover more risks, more competitively.
The Role
As an AI Engineer (LLM), you will play a critical role in developing our core Large Language Model (LLM) service.
Our LLM service underpins our Generative AI powered risk digitization platform, providing a unified interface for internal services to leverage the power of LLMs at scale, regardless of the underlying foundational model.
You will be responsible for building, deploying, and optimizing LLM-powered solutions that directly impact our customer's ability to understand and process risk in commercial insurance.
What You Will Be Doing
Problem Solving & Collaboration:
Engage deeply with domain experts and product managers to understand and define key business problems within risk processing in commercial insurance that can be solved with LLMs. 
Collaborate closely with consuming service teams to define clear, efficient, and scalable interfaces for LLM tasks. 
Development & Deployment:
Design, develop, test, and deploy domain-specific LLM tasks (e.g., information extraction, risk assessment, document summarization, etc.) that are readily consumable by other Cytora services. 
Stay up-to-date with the latest advancements in LLM technology and actively explore new models, techniques, and tools to enhance our capabilities e.g. Agentic AI. 
Evaluation & Optimization:
Develop and implement comprehensive evaluation metrics and tools to rigorously assess and iterate on the performance of LLM tasks. 
Analyze task performance, identify areas for improvement, and implement strategies to optimize accuracy, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. 
Production & Monitoring:
Monitor the performance of deployed LLM tasks in production, proactively identify and address issues, and ensure high reliability and accuracy. 
A successful candidate will likely have:
Problem-Solving: Strong analytical and problem-solving skills, with the ability to address complex AI challenges. 
Collaboration: Strong communication skills, with the ability to work effectively with cross-functional teams. 
Enthusiasm: A passion for using AI to solve complex problems and a willingness to learn. 
Experience in and strong knowledge of using AI/ML and more particularly LLMs e.g. 
Prompt engineering techniques
Agentic systems
Multiple LLM models
Experience in using LLMs for document processing tasks would be beneficial
Proficiency in Python and specifically with mypy and asyncio
Benefits
Stock options
Enhanced parental leave
