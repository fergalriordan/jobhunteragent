### Long Term

- [ ] Add an application Q&A helper node (at the end of each tailored application graph) to provide help with application questionnaires (i.e. a chatbot to help with questions like "Why do you want to work with us?" in application portal, but grounded in the context of the full user details info, tailored CV, company research, cover letter, etc)

- [ ] Add a selector/pre-screen node to determine which application components (CV, Cover Letter, LinkedIn message, etc) are needed for a given application

- [ ] Extend CV template configurability (user can select which fields are static, etc) and compatibility (alternate file formats, LaTeX, etc)

- [ ] Mature the solution (including the UX/UI) and deploy site

- [ ] Add company researching agent to augment cover letter and LinkedIn message generation

- [ ] Add job listing retrieval agent (complicated due to TOS of most job boards)
